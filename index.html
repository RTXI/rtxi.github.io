   <p class="lead">The Real-Time eXperiment Interface (RTXI) is a collaborative open-source software development project aimed at producing a real-time Linux-based software system for hard real-time data acquisition and control applications in biological research.</p>

   <p class="lead">The ability of experimentalists to perturb biological systems has traditionally been limited to rigid pre-programmed protocols or more flexible, but reflex constrained, operator-controlled protocols. In contrast, real-time control allows the researcher to dynamically probe a biological system with parameter perturbations that are calculated functions of instantaneous system measurements, thereby providing the ability to address diverse unanswered questions that are not amenable to traditional approaches. Real-time control applications are abundant throughout biological research, including, for example, dynamic probing of ion-channel function, control of cardiac arrhythmia dynamics, and control of deep-brain stimulation patterns.</p>
