It reads in the spike state of a connected spike detector module and, depending on the state of the detector and the specified ISI, outputs a current. The amplitude is determined by comparing the error between real ISI and the target. When error oscillates around the target, output is small, but when error increases, the output increases in amplitude.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/spike-statistics/">spike-statistics</a></td><td><p>This module contains a spike detector based on a positive threshold crossing (see SpikeDetect module).

This conductance is triggered by an event indicated by a value of “1″ on input(1). This can be used to generate a spike-triggered synaptic connection using the <a href="https://github.com/RTXI/spike-detector">Spike Detector module</a>. Use the connector module to connect the spike state output of the spike detector to the spike state input of this one.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/coupling/">coupling</a></td><td><p>This module reciprocally couples two neurons with alpha synapses. It requires the membrane potential of both cells and the inputs from two spike detector modules (eg. Spike Detect). It outputs the two synaptic currents which must then be appropriately connected.

To couple the neurons, the module should be unpaused, then the “Couple Neurons” toggle button can be activated/deactivated.
