The model automatically tunes the PI controller parameters to the neuron. The goal of the PI controller is to make small changes in current at each action potential onset to maintain the neuron at a target firing rate. This spike rate controller is designed to offset drift in the firing rate on the order of 10s of seconds to minutes. This module requires input from the “Spike Detector” module.</p><p>The module automatically calculates a first order model for the ISI as a function of the applied current. Given the first order model, it solves the coefficients for the critically damped solution of the proportional-integral controller with the constraint that the proportional coefficient is 1/100 of the Integral coefficient, to assure small changes with each spike.</p><p>Once a cell is patched, the spikes are detected with the spike detector module. The spike detector is connected to the input of the Auto-PI module and the Auto-PI’s output is sent back to the neuron. Set the desired ISI, set AUTOTUNE = 1 and unpause the module. The module will automatically apply a set of current steps to find an applied current to make neuron fire near the target firing rate, then it perturbs the current measuring the neuron’s response in time with each change. Once a first order model is fit to the neuron’s response, the AUTOTUNE turns off, setting the coefficients and switches automatically to closed loop control. Within about 10 spikes, the neuron should be close to the target firing rate.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Miranda-Domínguez O, Gonia J, Netoff TI.

You can randomize the order of amplitudes used and repeat the entire protocol a certain number of times. For current step inputs, you can also choose to plot the f-I curve as it is generated. For each complete cycle through all the command currents, the plot symbol will change. The firing rate is computed by taking the reciprocal of the average ISI detected during a command input. Plotting the f-I curve will also enable buttons that allow you to perform a linear regression, print the plot, save a screenshot in SVG format, or save the data points. Only the data points generated in the last run are saved and you can append them to an existing file. The linear regression is performed on ALL data points in the plot, not just those generated in the last run. If you add points to the plot and perform another regression, you will get another line. Zoom in on the plot by clicking and dragging with the mouse. Middle click to go back to the previous zoom. All the data points and coefficients and statistics for each regression are printed to the terminal.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/camera-control/">camera-control</a></td><td style="white-space: nowrap"><p>Adequate description pending.

It uses the current real-time period to determine the length of the trial, sampling one row from the ASCII file at each time step. If you use it with the Spike Detector module, you can view a raster plot in real-time of spike times for each trial. Simply use the connector module to send the command signals from the detector to this module.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/electric-synapse/">electric-synapse</a></td><td style="white-space: nowrap"><p>Creates a simulated connection, or &#39;synapse,&#39; between two cells.

Given the desired number of filter taps (filter order + 1), it computes the impulse response for a lowpass, highpass, bandpass, or bandstop filter using the window method. For a lowpass or highpass filter, the module uses the first frequency as the cut-off frequency. For a bandpass or bandstop filter, both input frequencies are used to define the frequency band. The module initially computes an ideal FIR filter to which you can apply a Triangular (or Bartlett), Hamming, Hann, Kaiser, or Dolph-Chebyshev window. The Hann window is not to be confused with the Hanning window (see MATLAB’s hann() vs. hanning() functions). To apply no window to the filter, choose the Rectangular filter. The Kaiser and Chebyshev windows each take a parameter that determines the attenuation of the sidelobes in the filter. The algorithms only accept an odd number of filter taps. If you enter an even number, the module will automatically add 1 to the number of filter taps.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/gen-net/">gen-net</a></td><td style="white-space: nowrap"><p>This plugin implements a framework for Hybrid Network experiments. Hybrid networks entail the coupling of biological circuit elements with simulated ones. Hybrid Network experiments have been historically hindered by the difficulty of implementing the network. This software package aims to address this problem by providing tools that allow for the automatic setup of the simulated portion of the network and by automating integration of biological neurons with simulated neurons.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/g-waveform/">g-waveform</a></td><td style="white-space: nowrap"><p>This module takes an external ASCII formatted file as input. The file should have four columns with units in Amps and Siemens: absolute_current AMPA GABA (NMDA)</p><p>There should be one value for each time step and the total length of the stimulus is determined by using the real-time period specified in the System-&gt;Control Panel. If you change the real-time period, the length of the trial is recomputed. This module automatically pauses itself when the protocol is complete.</p><p>If you are using the Data Recorder, be sure to open the Data Recorder AFTER you open this module or RTXI will crash. This module increments the trial number in the Data Recorder so that each trial will be a separate structure in the HDF5 file. If you do not open the Data Recorder, the module will still run as designed. This module will automatically start and stop the Data Recorder. You must make sure to specify a data filename and select the data you want to save.</p><p>Use the checkboxes to select a combination of dynamic clamp stimuli and/or TTL pulses. The dynamic clamp stimuli can be further filtered by using the checkboxes to make only certain conductances (or current) active. The dynamic clamp output and the TTL pulses are on two separate channels and must be assigned to the correct DAQ channels using the System-&gt;Connector.</p><p>There are both internal and external holding current parameters. The internal one is specified using the &#39;Holding Current (pA)&#39; field in this module&#39;s GUI and is active between repeated trials. When the external holding current is activated using the checkbox, you must provide the instance ID of the correct holding current module in the &#39;Ihold ID&#39; field. You will probably want to manually start the external Ihold module first. When this dynamic clamp module unpauses, it will pause the Ihold module, and vice versa.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/hfac/">hfac</a></td><td style="white-space: nowrap"><p>This module implements a protocol for performing conduction block experiments on nerve fibers using high frequency AC current (HFAC) stimuli. Action potentials in the nerve are evoked with a single biphase square pulse and the HFAC signal is a sinusoidal waveform. You have an option to select which component of the biphase pulse occurs first. The “Single AP Stim” button is used to send a single pulse that can be used to elicit individual responses. The “Enable HFAC” toggle button can be used at any time to turn the HFAC signal on or off. The “Run” button starts a protocol in which the HFAC signal is enabled and the action potential stimulus is automatically triggered after a certain delay. Synchronizing this module with the Data Recorder will create separate trials in the HDF5 file corresponding to the protocols initiated with the “Run” button.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/i-cell/">i-cell</a></td><td style="white-space: nowrap"><p>Module for a current-clamped cell.

It has no ripple in the pass band or the stop band, and because of this is sometimes called a maximally flat filter. The Butterworth filter achieves its flatness at the expense of a relatively wide transition region from pass band to stop band, with average transient characteristics.</p><p>The Chebyshev filter has a smaller transition region than the same-order Butterworth filter, at the expense of ripples in its pass band. The filter minimizes the height of the maximum ripple. If you use a Chebyshev filter, you should also choose the type of normalization to apply.</p><p>An Elliptical (Cauer) filter has a shorter transition region than the Chebyshev filter because it allows ripples in both the stop and pass bands, giving a much higher rate of attenuation in the stop band. Elliptical filters give better frequency discrimination, but have a degraded transient response.</p><p>The DSP libraries should already be installed in <code>/usr/local/lib/rtxi_includes/</code>.

An embedded guinea pig ventricular cardiomyocyte model is voltage clamped to the membrane potential of a patch clamped cardiomyocyte. Using one of the calculated currents of the model, an artificial current is scaled and injected into the patch clamped cell. This allows for artificial block or increase of a particular current through dynamic clamp.

It computes an intrinsic period P0 by averaging the most recent 5 of 10 ISIs. Thus, the value of P0 can change over time. The period after the perturbed period is designated as P1 and the period following P1 is designated as P2. The first and second order PRCs are computed as PRC1=(P1-P0)/P0 and PRC2=(P2-P0)/P0. By this convention, a delay in the spike yield a positive value and an advance yields a negative value. The phase of the perturbation stimulus is computed based on the most recent measured P0. To help you choose the fixed delay for the perturbations, use the “Measure intrinsic P0″ at the top of the module to begin computing a running average of measured ISIs. After you start running the module, the ISI textbox will simply display the current measured ISI. To run a PRC protocol by stepping through the specified fixed delays, click the “Measure PRC” button. Stop either mode of data collection by clicking the “Pause” button. The source code is heavily commented and the program logic is based on indexing the number of spikes that have occurred in each stimulus cycle. It is easy to change how the intrinsic period is computed and whether it is held constant during the entire experiment or recomputed. Similarly, you can easily change the sign convention for computing the phase shifts and extend the code to compute other phase response measures.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/spike-triggered-average/">spike-triggered-average</a></td><td style="white-space: nowrap"><p>This module computes an event or spike-triggered average of any input signal.

To couple the neurons, the module should be unpaused, then the “Couple Neurons” toggle button can be activated/deactivated. This module also computes the difference in time between the spiking of both cells so that coupling can be activated programmatically based on the delay. To use this feature, the “Couple Neurons” toggle button should be deactivated. The checkbox to “Automate coupling delay” should be activated before unpausing the module.

The model automatically tunes the PI controller parameters to the neuron. The goal of the PI controller is to make small changes in current at each action potential onset to maintain the neuron at a target firing rate. This spike rate controller is designed to offset drift in the firing rate on the order of 10s of seconds to minutes. This module requires input from the “Spike Detector” module.</p><p>The module automatically calculates a first order model for the ISI as a function of the applied current. Given the first order model, it solves the coefficients for the critically damped solution of the proportional-integral controller with the constraint that the proportional coefficient is 1/100 of the Integral coefficient, to assure small changes with each spike.</p><p>Once a cell is patched, the spikes are detected with the spike detector module. The spike detector is connected to the input of the Auto-PI module and the Auto-PI’s output is sent back to the neuron. Set the desired ISI, set AUTOTUNE = 1 and unpause the module. The module will automatically apply a set of current steps to find an applied current to make neuron fire near the target firing rate, then it perturbs the current measuring the neuron’s response in time with each change. Once a first order model is fit to the neuron’s response, the AUTOTUNE turns off, setting the coefficients and switches automatically to closed loop control. Within about 10 spikes, the neuron should be close to the target firing rate.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Miranda-Domínguez O, Gonia J, Netoff TI.

You can randomize the order of amplitudes used and repeat the entire protocol a certain number of times. For current step inputs, you can also choose to plot the f-I curve as it is generated. For each complete cycle through all the command currents, the plot symbol will change. The firing rate is computed by taking the reciprocal of the average ISI detected during a command input. Plotting the f-I curve will also enable buttons that allow you to perform a linear regression, print the plot, save a screenshot in SVG format, or save the data points. Only the data points generated in the last run are saved and you can append them to an existing file. The linear regression is performed on ALL data points in the plot, not just those generated in the last run. If you add points to the plot and perform another regression, you will get another line. Zoom in on the plot by clicking and dragging with the mouse. Middle click to go back to the previous zoom. All the data points and coefficients and statistics for each regression are printed to the terminal.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/camera-control/">camera-control</a></td><td><p>Adequate description pending. The precise purpose of this module is currently undetermined.

It uses the current real-time period to determine the length of the trial, sampling one row from the ASCII file at each time step. If you use it with the Spike Detector module, you can view a raster plot in real-time of spike times for each trial. Simply use the connector module to send the command signals from the detector to this module.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/electric-synapse/">electric-synapse</a></td><td><p>Creates a simulated connection, or &#39;synapse,&#39; between two cells. The module takes in voltage signals from two cells and outputs currents based on the voltage difference and user-specified conductance.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/fir-window/">fir-window</a></td><td><p>This module creates an in-line FIR filter that can be applied to any signal in RTXI. Given the desired number of filter taps (filter order + 1), it computes the impulse response for a lowpass, highpass, bandpass, or bandstop filter using the window method. For a lowpass or highpass filter, the module uses the first frequency as the cut-off frequency. For a bandpass or bandstop filter, both input frequencies are used to define the frequency band. The module initially computes an ideal FIR filter to which you can apply a Triangular (or Bartlett), Hamming, Hann, Kaiser, or Dolph-Chebyshev window. The Hann window is not to be confused with the Hanning window (see MATLAB’s hann() vs. hanning() functions). To apply no window to the filter, choose the Rectangular filter. The Kaiser and Chebyshev windows each take a parameter that determines the attenuation of the sidelobes in the filter. The algorithms only accept an odd number of filter taps. If you enter an even number, the module will automatically add 1 to the number of filter taps.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/gen-net/">gen-net</a></td><td><p>This plugin implements a framework for Hybrid Network experiments. Hybrid networks entail the coupling of biological circuit elements with simulated ones. Hybrid Network experiments have been historically hindered by the difficulty of implementing the network. This software package aims to address this problem by providing tools that allow for the automatic setup of the simulated portion of the network and by automating integration of biological neurons with simulated neurons.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/g-waveform/">g-waveform</a></td><td><p>This module takes an external ASCII formatted file as input. The file should have four columns with units in Amps and Siemens: absolute_current AMPA GABA (NMDA)</p><p>There should be one value for each time step and the total length of the stimulus is determined by using the real-time period specified in the System-&gt;Control Panel. If you change the real-time period, the length of the trial is recomputed. This module automatically pauses itself when the protocol is complete.</p><p>If you are using the Data Recorder, be sure to open the Data Recorder AFTER you open this module or RTXI will crash. This module increments the trial number in the Data Recorder so that each trial will be a separate structure in the HDF5 file. If you do not open the Data Recorder, the module will still run as designed. This module will automatically start and stop the Data Recorder. You must make sure to specify a data filename and select the data you want to save.</p><p>Use the checkboxes to select a combination of dynamic clamp stimuli and/or TTL pulses. The dynamic clamp stimuli can be further filtered by using the checkboxes to make only certain conductances (or current) active. The dynamic clamp output and the TTL pulses are on two separate channels and must be assigned to the correct DAQ channels using the System-&gt;Connector.</p><p>There are both internal and external holding current parameters. The internal one is specified using the &#39;Holding Current (pA)&#39; field in this module&#39;s GUI and is active between repeated trials. When the external holding current is activated using the checkbox, you must provide the instance ID of the correct holding current module in the &#39;Ihold ID&#39; field. You will probably want to manually start the external Ihold module first. When this dynamic clamp module unpauses, it will pause the Ihold module, and vice versa.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/hfac/">hfac</a></td><td><p>This module implements a protocol for performing conduction block experiments on nerve fibers using high frequency AC current (HFAC) stimuli. Action potentials in the nerve are evoked with a single biphase square pulse and the HFAC signal is a sinusoidal waveform. You have an option to select which component of the biphase pulse occurs first. The “Single AP Stim” button is used to send a single pulse that can be used to elicit individual responses. The “Enable HFAC” toggle button can be used at any time to turn the HFAC signal on or off. The “Run” button starts a protocol in which the HFAC signal is enabled and the action potential stimulus is automatically triggered after a certain delay. Synchronizing this module with the Data Recorder will create separate trials in the HDF5 file corresponding to the protocols initiated with the “Run” button.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/i-cell/">i-cell</a></td><td><p>Module for a current-clamped cell. Uses a simple Runge-Kutta solver to compute voltages based on a model of unknown identity and unknown parameters.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/iir-filter/">iir-filter</a></td><td><p>This module computes coefficients for three types of filters. They require the following parameters:</p><ol><li>Butterworth: passband edge<br></li><li>Chebyshev: passband ripple, passband edge<br></li><li>Elliptical: passband ripple, stopband ripple, passband edge, stopband edge<br></li></ol><p>You may save the computed coefficients and the filter’s parameters to a file.</p><p>The Butterworth filter is the best compromise between attenuation and phase response. It has no ripple in the pass band or the stop band, and because of this is sometimes called a maximally flat filter. The Butterworth filter achieves its flatness at the expense of a relatively wide transition region from pass band to stop band, with average transient characteristics.</p><p>The Chebyshev filter has a smaller transition region than the same-order Butterworth filter, at the expense of ripples in its pass band. The filter minimizes the height of the maximum ripple. If you use a Chebyshev filter, you should also choose the type of normalization to apply.</p><p>An Elliptical (Cauer) filter has a shorter transition region than the Chebyshev filter because it allows ripples in both the stop and pass bands, giving a much higher rate of attenuation in the stop band. Elliptical filters give better frequency discrimination, but have a degraded transient response.</p><p>The DSP libraries should already be installed in <code>/usr/local/lib/rtxi_includes/</code>. They were installed there when RTXI was installed.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/current-scale-dclamp/">current-scale-dclamp</a></td><td><p>This module is used to inject artificial conductances into a guinea pig cardiomyocytes through dynamic current clamp. An embedded guinea pig ventricular cardiomyocyte model is voltage clamped to the membrane potential of a patch clamped cardiomyocyte. Using one of the calculated currents of the model, an artificial current is scaled and injected into the patch clamped cell. This allows for artificial block or increase of a particular current through dynamic clamp. Currently, the Livshitz Rudy 2009 and Faber Rudy 2000 guinea pig models have been implemented in the module.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/current-hold/">current-hold</a></td><td><p>This module outputs a static value set by the user.

The duration of the ramp (rise and fall) is set via the Time parameter, along with the starting and peak current for the ramp. The module, when the &quot;RAMP!!!&quot; button is pressed, will initiate the ramp. If the &quot;Record data&quot; checkbox is set and the data recorder is already open and ready to write channels to a file, starting the ramp will also record data for its duration. If the module is unpaused and a ramp button is inactive, then it simply reads in the voltage from the connected analog input.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/current-step/">current-step</a></td><td><p>This plugin allows you to deliver a series of current step commands.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/phase-response-curve/">phase-response-curve</a></td><td><p>This module applies an alpha-shaped conductance to the cell at a fixed delay after 10 interspike intervals (ISI). It computes an intrinsic period P0 by averaging the most recent 5 of 10 ISIs. Thus, the value of P0 can change over time. The period after the perturbed period is designated as P1 and the period following P1 is designated as P2. The first and second order PRCs are computed as PRC1=(P1-P0)/P0 and PRC2=(P2-P0)/P0. By this convention, a delay in the spike yield a positive value and an advance yields a negative value. The phase of the perturbation stimulus is computed based on the most recent measured P0. To help you choose the fixed delay for the perturbations, use the “Measure intrinsic P0″ at the top of the module to begin computing a running average of measured ISIs. After you start running the module, the ISI textbox will simply display the current measured ISI. To run a PRC protocol by stepping through the specified fixed delays, click the “Measure PRC” button. Stop either mode of data collection by clicking the “Pause” button. The source code is heavily commented and the program logic is based on indexing the number of spikes that have occurred in each stimulus cycle. It is easy to change how the intrinsic period is computed and whether it is held constant during the entire experiment or recomputed. Similarly, you can easily change the sign convention for computing the phase shifts and extend the code to compute other phase response measures.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/modules/spike-triggered-average/">spike-triggered-average</a></td><td><p>This module computes an event or spike-triggered average of any input signal.

It reads in the spike state of a connected spike detector module and, depending on the state of the detector and the specified ISI, outputs a current.

It requires the membrane potential of both cells and the inputs from two spike detector modules (eg. Spike Detect). It outputs the two synaptic currents which must then be appropriately connected. This module can be used to couple two biological neurons or one biological neuron with a model neuron. To couple the neurons, the module should be unpaused, then the “Couple Neurons” toggle button can be activated/deactivated. This module also computes the difference in time between the spiking of both cells so that coupling can be activated programmatically based on the delay. To use this feature, the “Couple Neurons” toggle button should be deactivated. The checkbox to “Automate coupling delay” should be activated before unpausing the module. The difference in spike times between the two cells is continuously computed as Cell 2 – Cell 1.
