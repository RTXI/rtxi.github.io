<h3 class="page-header">DefaultGUI and the Plugin Template</h3>

<p>
This is an explanation for the code found in the <a href="/modules/plugin-template">plugin template module</a> and a brief introduction to the DefaultGUI framework it abstracts. The plugin template contains starter code for building new RTXI modules, though you can fork <a href="/modules">any other module</a>, too. Below are the contents of <code>plugin-template.cpp</code> and <code>plugin-template.h</code>. Click on a code block to display an explanation of how its code works. If anything is unclear, <a href="https://github.com/rtxi/rtxi.github.io/issues">let us know</a>.

This tutorial will assume the reader has a basic understanding of C++, such as including libraries and source files, classes, inheritance, etc. For a quick run-down of C++ for people already familiar with programming, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/">this</a> is a decent place to start.

	<p><code>default_gui_model.h</code> is the header for the <code>DefaultGUIModel</code> class that <code>PluginTemplate</code> abstracts from. The file itself is stored in <code>include/default_gui_model.h</code> in the <a href="https://github.com/rtxi/rtxi">RTXI repository</a>. <code>DefaultGUI</code> is on its own a mechanism by which users can create their own plugins. <code>PluginTemplate</code> simply obscures some of the more arcane functions and provides a more simplified programming experience.

	<p> The <code>PluginTemplate</code> abstracts from <code>DefaultGUIModel</code> to fit within RTXI's framework. To fit within the Qt framework, it uses the <code>Q_OBJECT</code> macro, which tells Qt's meta-object compiler to insert code into the class that implement signals and slots. Signals and slots are how different <code>QObjects</code> communicate with one another. One <code>QObject</code> sends a signal that is received by another <code>QObject</code>'s slot. The <code>Q_OBJECT</code> macro indicates that the class is to be treated as a <code>QObject</code>.

Whatever is run here should be as time and memory-efficient as possible. After all, to run RTXI at high frequencies (40-50 kHz) the code must take microseconds to execute. 
	</p>
	<p> The <code>customizeGUI</code> function is used to add and edit UI elements on the display. By default, <code>DefaultGUI</code> creates widget display that shows all user-designated parameter and state variables. For an example of what this looks like, view the UI for the <a href="https://github.com/rtxi/neuron/">neuron module</a>. To do things like add buttons or extra windows, the <code>customizeGUI</code> function is needed.

	<p><code>extern "C"</code> is implemented to prevent name-mangling by the C++ compiler. Normally, C++ uses name-mangling to allow many different definitions of an object with a same name. In other words, object names can be overloaded. Because this is a module, RTXI needs to load the dynamically-allocated module in memory. If the name gets mangled by the C++ compiler, then RTXI has to look for whatever that name was mangled into; however, RTXI cannot do this, meaning that it will be unable to find any name-mangled module. Therefore, we use <code>extern "C"</code>.

<div class="collapse" id="source3">
	<p><code>vars[]</code> is an array that contains instances of the <code>variable_t</code> struct, which is defined in <code>DefaultGUIModel</code>. <code>vars[]</code> is used to pass variables to be the <code>DefaultGUIModel</code> constructor. In the base code for this module, there are two variables, <code>GUI label</code> and <code>A State</code>. Each is separately instantiated within <code>vars[]</code>.
	</p>

	<p>Each element added to <code>vars[]</code> must have at least three components:</p>
	<dl class="dl-horizontal">
		<dt>string name</dt>
			<dd>the label for the variable made visible in the GUI</dd>
		<dt>string description</dt>
			<dd>tooltip description displayed when the mouse hovers over the label</dd>
		<dt>flags_t flags</dt>
			<dd>the type for the variable, such as <code>STATE</code>, <code>PARAMETER</code>, <code>INPUT</code>, <code>OUTPUT</code>, or <code>COMMENT</code></dd>
	</dl>

	<p>Note that the strings are of type <code>std::string</code>. Qt has its own string implementation, called <code>QString</code>, so take care to not confuse ordinary C strings with them. Also note that <code>flags_t</code> type is defined in <code>io.h</code>. It is an unsigned long int used within RTXI for input and output processing. Simply put, it is a method RTXI uses to define different types for variables that represent different components to be displayed by the GUI and/or processed by the module.
	</p>

	<p>Additional information about the type parameter can be added by using the <code>|</code> operator. Note that <code>|</code> here represents a bitwise OR operator. What this additional information does is apply an RTXI-specific data type to a variable within <code>vars[]</code>. In the base code for GUI label, the variable is of type <code>PARAMETER</code>, and <code>| DOUBLE</code> means that the variable is a parameter of type <code>DOUBLE</code>, a data type that stores 8-byte floating point numbers. If we wanted integers, we would use <code>INTEGER</code> instead of <code>DOUBLE</code>. Again, note that <code>PARAMETER</code>, <code>INTEGER</code>, etc. are not native C++ types but instead are RTXI-specific. 
	</p>

	<p>The GUI is made by iterating through all the elements of <code>vars[]</code> and appending a widget to the GUI window for each one. Because the vars array does not have a native count of the number of elements within, we create a variable called <code>num_vars</code> that stores that number.
	</p>

	<p>The size of the elements within are contingent on their types, so the <code>variable_t</code> type is used within the <code>sizeof()</code> command. Because the count of variables cannot change after the module is compiled and run within RTXI, <code>num_vars</code> is declared as static, meaning that it cannot be changed from within the program after it is initialized.

	<p><b>Do not</b> operate on a Qt widget within the execute loop. Doing so forces the system to alter what is being displayed on the screen, which involves calls to the X server, video driver, the standard Linux kernel (if modesetting is active), etc., and all that has to be completed within the real-time period. Needless to say, that's an easy way to get knocked out of real-time. Don't run UI things within the execute loop.

<div class="collapse" id="source7">
	<p>The <code>customizeGUI</code> function is designed for users to customize the default UI output created by the <code>DefaultGUIModel</code> class. The initial module is created by the <code>createGUI</code> function called above in the constructor. Broadly speaking, this function takes the output of <code>createGUI</code> and adds custom elements to it. To use this function, you will need to know what the Qt classes are and how to use them properly. Documentation is available on the Qt website. (<a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5.5/">http://doc.qt.io/qt-5.5/</a>)
	</p>
	<p>To customize the module UI, it first needs to be grabbed and stored in a variable, which is accomplished in the first line of the function. <code>DefaultGUIModel::getLayout()</code> returns an object of type <code>QGridLayout</code>. This essentially is a widget that allows Qt objects to be aligned according to a grid layout. The layout of <code>DefaultGUIModel</code> is as follows:  
	</p>
	<img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/img/tutorials/default_gui_layout.svg" style="max-height:450px;"></img>
	<br>
	<p>By default, the main UI is displayed within the grid at coordinates (1,0) and the utility box with the pause, modify, and exit buttons at coordinates (10,0). All other positions on the grid are empty.</p>
	<p>Note that the size of grid coordinates are arbitrary. They are as big as the widgets that are stuck within them. They're equally-sized in the diagram just for clarity. Look through Qt's documentation for instructions on how to set widgets at specific positions in the grid layout. 
	</p>
	<p>Also, note that coordinates that are empty are not rendered, so there is no big gap between the Main UI and the Button UI because there is nothing put in spots (2,0) to (9,0). Keep in mind, though, that the <code>QGridLayout</code> will not allow objects in diffrent rows to overlap. For example, if you added an object to (1,5), the UI in (0,1) would render, followed by a gap the size of the widget in (1,5), and then the buttons in (0,10). The object in (1,5) would be shown in column 1. 
	</p>

	<p>The rest of the code in <code>customizeGUI</code> creates two buttons and sticks them into coordinate (0,0). The buttons are then connected to functions using Qt's signals and slots API. When a button is pressed, it emits a signal that it has been pressed, and the <code>connect</code> connects that signal to a function. The effect is then to call the function whenever the button is pressed.
	</p>

	<p>When all the modifications are complete, they need to be added to the module layout that was grabbed by <code>DefaultGUIModel::getLayout()</code>. This is done using the <code>setLayout</code> command.
