<h4 class="page-header">Data Acquisition Cards</h4>
<p>
For closed loop experiments using RTXI, your computer must be equipped with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to acquire data and a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to generate signals. Of course, external hardware such as an oscilloscope or function (waveform) generator can be used in conjunction with RTXI. A popular option is to purchase a commercial multifunction data acquisition card that provides analog input and output, digital input and output, and counter/timer circuitry. DAQ cards using the USB interface are \attention \emph{not compatible} with RTXI because USB drivers in Linux are not capable of hard real-time operation. Furthermore, the USB interface can only achieve a maximum sampling rate of approximately 1 kHz, insufficient for some closed-loop real-time applications. Many DAQ cards using the PCI, PCI express, or PXI interface are available from a variety of manufacturers. Your choice of DAQ card should depend on the number of analog and/or digital channels that you need, the amount of data resolution (eg. 12, 16-bit), sampling resolution, speed, and whether you need simultaneous or sequential sampling of multiple input channels.
</p>

<p>
Most RTXI users use products developed by National Instruments. ANALOGY, a set of drivers derived from COMEDI, provides support for many NI DAQs, for low-level drivers for cards using a 8255 chip for three channels of 8 bit digital input or output, and for standard PC parallel ports. A list of currently supported NI cards and their corresponding ANALOGY driver is given in Table \ref{ANALOGY NI}. A list of other ANALOGY-supported DAQ manufacturers is given in Table \ref{DAQs}.\index{hardware requirements}

<h5 class="page-header">Adding more DAQ cards</h5>
<p>
RTXI has no built-in software limitations on the number of DAQ cards but is configured for only one card by default. If you want to use additional cards, you will need to edit the configuration file. Here is the relevant excerpt of \texttt{/etc/rtxi.conf}:\index{DAQ, multiple cards}\index{RTXI, configuration}
</p>
{% highlight xml %}
<OBJECT component="plugin" library="comedi\_driver.so" id="2">\\
<PARAM name="0">/dev/comedi0</PARAM>\\
<PARAM name="Num Devices">1</PARAM>\\
<OBJECT id="13" name="0" />\\
</OBJECT>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Edit the lines to add another COMEDI device and change the number of devices:
</p>
{% highlight xml %}
<PARAM name="0">/dev/comedi0</PARAM>\\
<PARAM name="1">/dev/comedi1</PARAM>\\
<PARAM name="Num Devices">2</PARAM>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
You will need to exit and restart RTXI for the new configuration to take effect. Settings files that you have already created should still work when you change \texttt{rtxi.conf} but you may not have access to both DAQ cards in the System Control Panel, the Oscilloscope, and the Connector. You will have to rebuild those settings files or edit them as above using your choice of text editor.
</p>

<p>
RTXI automatically detects the manufacturer and board names of available DAQ cards and the number and type of input and output channels. The first DAQ card installed in your system is assigned the Linux device name: \texttt{/dev/comedi0}. Additional DAQ cards are assigned device names \texttt{/dev/comedi1} and so on. You can check that your DAQ card has been correctly detected and see the corresponding device name by clicking \textbf{Help}$\rightarrow$\textbf{About COMEDI} from the RTXI menu bar.
</p>

<p>
To calibrate your DAQ card, use the comedi\_calibrate utility as follows for each COMEDI device:
{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo comedi_calibrate --reset --dump --calibrate --results --verbose /dev/comedi0
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
If you are using a National Instruments M-Series card, you will need to use the <code>comedi_soft_calibrate</code> utility instead.
