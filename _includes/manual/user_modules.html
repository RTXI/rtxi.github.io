<p>
RTXI comes with a set of core system modules but also enables users to install
custom modules. All modules are compiled as Linux shared object libraries
(*.so) that are linked into the core system. This allows RTXI to have minimal
overhead and user modules are loaded only as needed. This architecture also
allows multiple instantiations of user modules so that elements such as filters
and event detectors can be reused on a variety of signals.
</p>

<p>
The compilation and installation process will create an RTXI shared object
library (*.so extension) in <code>/usr/local/lib/rtxi</code>, where RTXI will
initially look for them. User modules must be recompiled if any changes are
made to their sources after installation. Note that when reinstalling modules,
the corresponding *.so files are overwritten, so always make sure that
different modules have unique names.
