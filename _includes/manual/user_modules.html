<h3 class="page-header">Installing User Modules</h3>
<p>
RTXI comes with a set of core system modules. All modules are compiled as Linux shared object libraries that are linked into the core system. This allows RTXI to have minimal overhead and user modules are loaded only as needed. This architecture also allows multiple instantiations of user modules so that elements such as filters and event detectors can be reused on a variety of signals.
</p>

<p>
A list of available modules is available on this website (http://www.rtxi.org/modules). You can download them through our GitHub repository (https://github.com/RTXI). Each module usually consists of a header file (*.h), class implementation file (*.cpp), a Makefile that informs the GCC compiler, a README file, and a LICENSE. 
</p>

<p>
If you have Git installed, you can also download and install modules by running:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone https://github.com/rtxi/<MODULE_NAME>.git
$ cd <MODULE_NAME>
$ make
$ sudo make install
{% endhighlight %} 

<p>
The compilation and installation process will create an RTXI shared object library (*.so extension) in <code>/usr/local/lib/rtxi</code>, where RTXI will initially look for them. User modules must be recompiled if any changes are made to their sources after installation. Note that when reinstalling modules, the corresponding *.so files are overwritten, so always make sure that different modules have unique names.
