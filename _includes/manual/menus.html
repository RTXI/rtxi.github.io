<h4 class="page-header">RTXI System Menu</h4>
<p>
Although RTXI is dependent on Linux, it is a complete desktop application and configuration of system settings and interaction with most features are available through a graphical user interface.

The \textbf{File Menu} is used to save and load settings files that capture the entire working environment. This includes settings configured in the System Control Panel, such as channel gains, parameters set within modules, and connections between modules. Reloading a settings files will also restore the window sizes and positions at the time the file was created. Recently used settings files are also available from this menu.
