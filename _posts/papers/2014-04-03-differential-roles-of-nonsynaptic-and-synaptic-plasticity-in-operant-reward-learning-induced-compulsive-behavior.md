Rewarding stimuli in associative learning can transform the irregularly and
infrequently generated motor patterns underlying motivated behaviors into
output for accelerated and stereotyped repetitive action. This transition to
compulsive behavioral expression is associated with modified synaptic and
membrane properties of central neurons, but establishing the causal
relationships between cellular plasticity and motor adaptation has remained a
challenge.  

We found previously that changes in the intrinsic excitability and electrical
synapses of identified neurons in Aplysia’s central pattern-generating network
for feeding are correlated with a switch to compulsive-like motor output
expression induced by in vivo operant conditioning. Here, we used specific
computer-simulated ionic currents in vitro to selectively replicate or suppress
the membrane and synaptic plasticity resulting from this learning.  In naive in
vitro preparations, such experimental manipulation of neuronal membrane
properties alone increased the frequency but not the regularity of feeding
motor output found in preparations from operantly trained animals. On the other
hand, changes in synaptic strength alone switched the regularity but not the
frequency of feeding output from naive to trained states.  However,
simultaneously imposed changes in both membrane and synaptic properties
reproduced both major aspects of the motor plasticity. Conversely, in
preparations from trained animals, experimental suppression of the membrane and
synaptic plasticity abolished the increase in frequency and regularity of the
learned motor output expression.  

These data establish direct causality for the contributions of distinct
synaptic and nonsynaptic adaptive processes to complementary facets of a
compulsive behavior resulting from operant reward learning.
