Synaptic waveforms, constructed from excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic
Poisson trains, are presented to living and computational neurons. We review
how the average output of a neuron e.g., the firing rate is set by the
difference between excitatory and inhibitory event rates while neuronal
variability is set by their sum. We distinguish neuronal variability from
reproducibility. Variability quantifies how much an output measure is expected
to vary; for example, the interspike interval coefficient of variation
quantifies the typical range of interspike intervals. Reproducibility
quantifies the similarity of neuronal outputs in response to repeated
presentations of identical stimuli. Although variability and reproducibility
are conceptually distinct, we show that, for ideal current source synapses,
reproducibility is defined entirely by variability. For physiologically
realistic conductance-based synapses, however, reproducibility is distinct from
variability and average output, set by the Poisson rate and the degree of
synchrony within the synaptic waveform.
