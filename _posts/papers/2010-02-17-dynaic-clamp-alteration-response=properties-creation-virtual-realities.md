The vast repertoire of electrical activity displayed by neurons, cardiac
myocytes, and various endocrine and sensory cells is the result of
membrane-bound ion channels each producing a distinct conductance that
facilitates current flux through the membrane. These conductances may be
static, or their magnitudes may be voltage or ligand dependent. Dynamic clamp,
a term for the various combinations of software and hardware that simulate
these conductances, has proven to be a valuable tool for electrophysiologists
studying excitable cells. One can think of dynamic clamp as a tool for
immersing neurons in virtual reality-inspired experiments. Virtual synapses may
be simulated, allowing a biological neuron to communicate with or receive
inputs from real and simulated cells. Dynamic clamp can also be used to
introduce virtual voltage-gated channels into biological neurons, thus altering
the neurons integrative properties. This Toolbox article includes a brief
description of how conductances are simulated as well as a discussion of the
neurophysiological applications of dynamic clamp and its potential pitfalls.
The origins of dynamic clamp, its implementation, and its applications to
cardiac and endocrine electrophysiology have been reviewed elsewhere (Sharp et
al., 1993; Prinz et al., 2003; Goaillard and Marder, 2006; Wilders, 2006;
Destexhe and Bal, 2009).
