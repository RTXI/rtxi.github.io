Dopaminergic neurons of the ventral midbrain fire high-frequency bursts when
animals are presented with unexpected rewards, or stimuli that predict reward.
To identify the afferents that can initiate bursting and establish therapeutic
strategies for diseases affected by altered bursting, a mechanistic
understanding of bursting is essential. Our results show that bursting is
initiated by a specific interaction between the voltage sensitivity of NMDA
receptors and voltage-gated ion channels that results in the activation of an
intrinsic, action potential-independent, high-frequency membrane potential
oscillation. We further show that the NMDA receptor is uniquely suited for this
because of the rapid kinetics and voltage dependence imparted to it by Mg2+ ion
block and unblock. This mechanism explains the discrete nature of bursting in
dopaminergic cells and demonstrates how synaptic signals may be reshaped by
local intrinsic properties of a neuron before influencing action potential
generation.
