We studied single neuron dynamics during anoxic depolarizations, which are
often observed in cases of neuronal energy depletion. Anoxic and similar
depolarizations play an important role in several pathologies, notably stroke,
migraine, and epilepsy. One of the effects of energy depletion was
experimentally simulated in slices of rat cortex by blocking the
sodium-potassium pumps with ouabain. The membrane voltage of pyramidal cells
was measured. Five different kinds of dynamical behavior of the membrane
voltage were observed during the resulting depolarizations. Using bifurcation
analysis of a single cell model, we show that these voltage dynamics all are
responses of the same cell, with normally functioning ion channels, to
particular courses of the intra- and extracellular concentrations of sodium and
potassium.
