Cardiac alternans, a putative trigger event for cardiac reentry, is a
beat-to-beat alternation in membrane potential and calcium transient. Alternans
was originally attributed to instabilities in transmembrane ion channel
dynamics (i.e., the voltage mechanism). As of this writing, the predominant
view is that instabilities in subcellular calcium handling are the main
underlying mechanism. That being said, because the voltage and calcium systems
are bidirectionally coupled, theoretical studies have suggested that both
mechanisms can contribute. To date, to our knowledge, no experimental evidence
of such a dual role within the same cell has been reported. Here, a combined
electrophysiological and calcium imaging approach was developed and used to
illuminate the contributions of voltage and calcium dynamics to alternans. An
experimentally feasible protocol, quantification of subcellular calcium
alternans and restitution slope during cycle-length ramping alternans control,
was designed and validated. This approach allows simultaneous illumination of
the contributions of voltage and calcium-driven instability to total cellular
instability as a function of cycle-length. Application of this protocol in in
vitro guinea-pig left-ventricular myocytes demonstrated that both voltage- and
calcium-driven instabilities underlie alternans, and that the relative
contributions of the two systems change as a function of pacing rate.
