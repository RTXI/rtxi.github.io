Studies of behavioral and neural responses to distorted auditory feedback (DAF)
can help shed light on the neural mechanisms of animal vocalizations. We
describe an apparatus for generating real-time acoustic feedback. The system
can very rapidly detect acoustic features in a song and output acoustic signals
if the detected features match the desired acoustic template. The system uses
spectrogram-based detection of acoustic elements. It is low-cost and can be
programmed for a variety of behavioral experiments requiring acoustic feedback
or neural stimulation. We use the system to study the effects of acoustic
feedback on birds' vocalizations and demonstrate that such an acoustic feedback
can cause both immediate and long-term changes to birds' songs.
