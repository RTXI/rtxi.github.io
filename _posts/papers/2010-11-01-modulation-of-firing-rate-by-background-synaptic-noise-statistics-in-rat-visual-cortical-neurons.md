It has been shown previously that background synaptic noise modulates the
response gain of neocortical neurons. However, the role of the statistical
properties of the noise in modulating firing rate is not known. Here, the
dependence of firing rate on the statistical properties of the excitatory to
inhibitory balance (EI) in cortical pyramidal neurons was investigated.
Excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABA-ergic synaptic conductances were
simulated as two stochastic processes and injected into individual neurons in
vitro through use of the dynamic-clamp system. Response gain was significantly
modulated as a function of the statistical interactions between excitatory and
inhibitory synaptic conductances. Firing rates were compared for noisy synaptic
conductance steps by varying either the EI correlation or the relative delay
between correlated E and I. When inhibitory synaptic conductances exhibited a
short temporal delay (5 ms) relative to correlated excitatory synaptic
conductances, the response gain was increased compared to noise with no
temporal delay but with an equivalent degree of correlation. The dependence of
neuronal firing rate on the EI delay of the noisy background synaptic
conductance suggests that individual excitatory pyramidal neurons are sensitive
to the EI balance of the synaptic conductance. Therefore, the statistical EI
interactions encoded within the synaptic subthreshold membrane fluctuations are
able to modulate neuronal firing properties.
