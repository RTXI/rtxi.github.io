Many biomedical experiments require a precisely timed real-time (RT) computer
interface. Because commonly used desktop operating systems are inherently
non-real-time, real-time laboratory computer systems are often based on
outdated DOS software or expensive proprietary real-time operating systems.
Here we discuss a real-time computing system, based on the free RT-Linux
operating system, which we have developed for adaptive pacing control in a
clinical cardiac electrophysiology laboratory. This powerful, flexible, and
inexpensive system demonstrates that RT-Linux is well suited for real-time
biomedical experiment interface.
