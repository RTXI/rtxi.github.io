Dynamic clamp is a collection of closely related techniques that have been
employed in cardiac electrophysiology to provide direct answers to numerous
research questions regarding basic cellular mechanisms of action potential
formation, action potential transfer and action potential synchronization in
health and disease. Building on traditional current clamp, dynamic clamp was
initially used to create virtual gap junctions between isolated myocytes. More
recent applications include the embedding of a real pacemaking myocyte in a
simulated network of atrial or ventricular cells and the insertion of virtual
ion channels, either simulated in real time or simultaneously recorded from an
expression system, into the membrane of an isolated myocyte. These applications
have proven that dynamic clamp, which is characterized by the real-time
evaluation and injection of simulated membrane current, is a powerful tool in
cardiac electrophysiology. Here, each of the three different experimental
configurations used in cardiac electrophysiology is reviewed. Also, directions
are given for the implementation of dynamic clamp in the cardiac
electrophysiology laboratory. With the growing interest in the application of
dynamic clamp in cardiac electrophysiology, it is anticipated that dynamic
clamp will also prove to be a powerful tool in basic research on biological
pacemakers and in identification of specific ion channels as targets for drug
development.
