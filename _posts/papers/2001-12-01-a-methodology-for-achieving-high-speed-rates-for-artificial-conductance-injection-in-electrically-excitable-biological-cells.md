We present a novel approach to implementing the dynamic-clamp protocol (Sharp
et al., 1993), commonly used in neurophysiology and cardiac electrophysiology
experiments. Our approach is based on real-time extensions to the Linux
operating system. Conventional PC-based approaches have typically utilized
single-cycle computational rates of 10 kHz or slower. In thispaper, we
demonstrate reliable cycle-to-cycle rates as fast as 50 kHz. Our system, which
we call model reference current injection (MRCI); pronounced mercí is also
capable of episodic logging of internal state variables and interactive
manipulation of model parameters. The limiting factor in achieving high speeds
was not processor speed or model complexity, but cycle jitter inherent in the
CPU/motherboard performance. We demonstrate these high speeds and flexibility
with two examples: 1) adding action-potential ionic currents to a mammalian
neuron under whole-cell patch-clamp and 2) altering a cell’s intrinsic dynamics
via MRCI while simultaneously coupling it via artificial synapses to an
internal computational model cell. These higher rates greatly extend the
applicability of this technique to the study of fast electrophysiological
currents such fast Na+ currents and fast excitatory/inhibitory synapses.
