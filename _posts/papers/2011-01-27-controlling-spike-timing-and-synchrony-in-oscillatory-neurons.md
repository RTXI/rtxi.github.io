We describe an algorithm to control synchrony between two periodically firing
neurons. The control scheme operates in real-time using a dynamic clamp
platform. This algorithm is a low impact stimulation method that brings the
neurons toward the desired level of synchrony over the course of several neuron
firing periods. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate the versatility of the
algorithm using real- time conductance models, and then show its performance
with biological neurons of hippocampal region CA1 and entorhinal cortex.
