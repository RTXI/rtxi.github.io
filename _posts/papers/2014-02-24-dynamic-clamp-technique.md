Dynamic clamp is an electrophysiological technique for introducing simulated electrical components into biological cells using a real-time closed loop between the cell and a computer or another electronic device. Classic dynamic clamp protocols build a voltage-dependent current injection cycle to implement artificial membrane or synaptic conductances in the cell membrane of biological neurons. These protocols are employed to assess a large variety of neuronal computational properties and are widely applied for studying the physiology of neural systems at the cellular and circuit levels.
