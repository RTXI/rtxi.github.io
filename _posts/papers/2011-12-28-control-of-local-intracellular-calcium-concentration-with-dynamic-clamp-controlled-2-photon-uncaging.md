The variations of the intracellular concentration of calcium ion ([Ca2+]i) are
at the heart of intracellular signaling, and their imaging is therefore of
enormous interest. However, passive [Ca2+]i imaging provides no control over
these variations, meaning that a full exploration of the functional
consequences of [Ca2+]i changes is difficult to attain. The tools designed so
far to modify [Ca2+]i, even qualitatively, suffer drawbacks that undermine
their widespread use. Here, we describe an electro-optical technique to
quantitatively set [Ca2+]i, in real time and with sub-cellular resolution,
using two-photon Ca2+ uncaging and dynamic-clamp. We experimentally
demonstrate, on neurons from acute olfactory bulb slices of Long Evans rats,
various capabilities of this technique previously difficult to achieve, such as
the independent control of the membrane potential and [Ca2+]i variations, the
functional knocking-in of user-defined virtual voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels,
and the standardization of [Ca2+]i patterns across different cells. Our goal is
to lay the groundwork for this technique and establish it as a new and
versatile tool for the study of cell signaling.
