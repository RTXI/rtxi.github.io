Cardiac action potential duration alternans is characterized by a beat-to-beat alternation in action potential waveform. Its presence has been putatively linked to the onset of lethal cardiac arrhythmias. Previous studies, which have been limited to cardiac Purkinje fibers, have shown that closed-loop alternans control techniques, which apply a succession of externally administered cycle perturbations, provide ineffectual spatial alternans elimination. A more complete understanding of alternans control in the more clinically relevant ventricular tissue is needed. Here, we study the spatial dynamics of alternans and alternans control in arterially perfused canine right ventricular preparations using optical mapping. We quantified the spatial efficacy of alternans control across 2.5 cm of tissue, focusing primarily on differences in spatial control within several sub-regions of tissue. Our results provide a basis for future investigations into multi-electrode-based control interventions of alternans in cardiac tissue.
