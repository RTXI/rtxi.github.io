Understanding central processing requires precise monitoring of neural activity
across populations of identified neurons in the intact brain. In the present
study, we used recently optimized variants of the genetically encoded calcium
sensor GCaMP (GCaMP3 and GCaMPG5G) to image activity among genetically and
anatomically defined neuronal populations in the olfactory bulb (OB), including
two types of GABAergic interneurons (periglomerular [PG] and short axon [SA]
cells) and OB output neurons (mitral/tufted [MT] cells) projecting to the
piriform cortex. We first established that changes in neuronal spiking can be
related accurately to GCaMP fluorescence changes via a simple quantitative
relationship over a large dynamic range. We next used in vivo two-photon
imaging from individual neurons and epifluorescence signals reflecting
population-level activity to investigate the spatiotemporal representation of
odorants across these neuron types in anesthetized and awake mice. Under
anesthesia, individual PG and SA cells showed temporally simple responses and
little spontaneous activity, whereas MT cells were spontaneously active and
showed diverse temporal responses. At the population level, response patterns
of PG, SA, and MT cells were surprisingly similar to those imaged from sensory
inputs, with shared odorant-specific topography across the dorsal OB and
inhalation-coupled temporal dynamics. During wakefulness, PG and SA cell
responses increased in magnitude but remained temporally simple, whereas those
of MT cells changed to complex spatiotemporal patterns reflecting restricted
excitation and widespread inhibition. These results suggest multiple circuit
elements with distinct roles in transforming odor representations in the OB and
provide a framework for further study of early olfactory processing using
optical and genetic tools.
