The Real-time Experiment Interface (RTXI) is a fast and versatile real-time
biological experimentation system based on Real-Time Linux. RTXI is open source
and free, can be used with an extensive range of experimentation hardware, and
can be run on Linux or Windows computers (when using the Live CD). RTXI is
currently used extensively for two experiment types: dynamic patch clamp and
closed-loop stimulation pattern control in neural and cardiac single cell
electrophysiology. RTXI includes standard modules for implementing commonly
used electrophysiology protocols with synchronized stimulation, event
detection, and online analysis. These and other user-contributed modules can be
found on the website (http://www.rtxi.org).
