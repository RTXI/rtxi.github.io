Phase response curves (PRCs) for a single neuron are often used to predict the
synchrony of mutually coupled neurons. Previous theoretical work on
pulse-coupled oscillators used single-pulse perturbations. We propose an
alternate method in which functional PRCs (fPRCs) are generated using a train
of pulses applied at a fixed delay after each spike, with the PRC measured when
the phasic relationship between the stimulus and the subsequent spike in the
neuron has converged. The essential information is the dependence of the
recovery time from pulse onset until the next spike as a function of the delay
between the previous spike and the onset of the applied pulse. Experimental
fPRCs in Aplysia pacemaker neurons were different from single-pulse PRCs,
principally due to adaptation. In the biological neuron, convergence to the
fully adapted recovery interval was slower at some phases than that at others
because the change in the effective intrinsic period due to adaptation changes
the effective phase resetting in a way that opposes and slows the effects of
adaptation. The fPRCs for two isolated adapting model neurons were used to
predict the existence and stability of 1: 1 phase-locked network activity when
the two neurons were coupled. A stability criterion was derived by linearizing
a coupled map based on the fPRC and the existence and stability criteria were
successfully tested in two-simulated-neuron networks with reciprocal inhibition
or excitation. The fPRC is the first PRC-based tool that can account for
adaptation in analyzing networks of neural oscillators.
