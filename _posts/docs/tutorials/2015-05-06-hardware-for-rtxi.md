If you're buying new equipment to use for RTXI, there are some things you should consider in before your purchase. They are all easy to meet, and they'll help you get set up with a properly performing installation of RTXI.  

####Computer
Most computers built in the last few years will run Linux, but some will perform better for real-time applications. Here are some points to consider when buying new hardware:  

1. **What is the CPU type?** We recommend using Intel processors, though AMD ones work, too.  
2. **How many PCI/PCIe slots are there?** You will need one PCI or PCIe slot for a graphics card and another PCI slot for a DAQ.  
3. **What type of graphics card is needed?** Use an AMD card rather than an Nvidia one.  


####Resources
Here is a list of resources for hardware that different drivers support.   

1. [**AMD driver (radeon)**](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver#Fully_Supported)  
2. [**Nvidia driver (nouveau)**](https://wiki.freedesktop.org/nouveau/FAQ/#index14h3)  
3. [**DAQ driver (analogy)**](https://xenomai.org/analogy-practical-presentation/#ni_pcimio)
