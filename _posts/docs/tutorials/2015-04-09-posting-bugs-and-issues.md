RTXI is in active development, and our work depends heavily on user feedback. This tutorial provides instructions for creating bug reports, posting questions about issues, making feature requests, etc. through GitHub. Though email will also work, we strongly encourage using GitHub so that users can see existing issues and contribute to overall discussion. To use GitHub, you will need to create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).  

**Note:** For the sake of absolute clarity, please do not actually create an issue in the process of going though this tutorial.
