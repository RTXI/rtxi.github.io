There are a lot of things you need to know to be able to fully use RTXI. Fortunately, these things aren't hard to learn, and there is already plenty of documentation online to help you learn it. This is a non-exhaustive list of some good resources to learn what you need. They aren't listed in any specific order.  


####Using Git 
1. [http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
2. [http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
3. [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/)

####Using GitHub
1. [https://guides.github.com/](https://guides.github.com/)

####Learning Programming and C++
1. [http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/) (prior programming experience helps)
2. [http://www.penguinprogrammer.co.uk/c-beginners-tutorial/](http://www.penguinprogrammer.co.uk/c-beginners-tutorial/)

####Qt and GUI Creation
1. [http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/](http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/])  
**Note:** Be careful with some of the Qt tutorials. You don't need to instatiate things like QApplication objects, create qmake.pro files, etc. because RTXI takes care of that. Pay attention to what the UI classes are and how to use the signal/slot API.  

Again, this is a non-exhaustive list of a tiny subset of all that's available online and in print. It takes time to learn these things, just as it does with anything else.
