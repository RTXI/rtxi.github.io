We currently do not support RTAI. Earlier versions (1.x) did, but limited time
and other development priorities mean we no longer focus any effort on
maintaining our RTAI/COMEDI interface. 

For RTXI 3 however we are able to more easily support other real-time platforms, 
so if this is something that interests you feel free to contact us and we can 
add support for RTAI.
