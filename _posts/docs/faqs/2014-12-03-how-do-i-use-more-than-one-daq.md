RTXI automatically detects installed devices for the drivers it supports. As of February 2024,
it supports National Instruments DAQ cards. To properly detect supported devices, make sure to
install supported drivers **before** you install RTXI, or else the installation will not attempt
to install relevant RTXI drivers.

If there are issues detecting or using the supported devices, please feel free to contact us or
file an issue on GitHub (recommended).
