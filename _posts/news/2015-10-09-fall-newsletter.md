There have been lots of new developments in RTXI over the past few months. Look forward to the upcoming release of RTXI 2.1, and we encourage those of you attending SfN 2015 to check out our poster!

#### Upcoming Features in RTXI 2.1

 * **New Plotting Tools** - We've created a new analysis-tools module that will directly plot HDF data saved by the data recorder.


 * **UI Upgrades** - We've upgraded RTXI's UI framework from Qt4 to Qt5, the most up-to-date version available.


 * **Bugfixes and Tweaks** - RTXI is continually improving under the hood, and for 2.1, we bundled in lots of bugfixes, UI tweaks, and performance enhancements.


 * **Improved User-friendliness** - RTXI now checks for updates, and the new module-installer makes finding and installing the modules you need easier than ever.

 * **Arduino Support** - The new Arduino module provides an interface between RTXI and Arduino computers. Note that this is non-RT.


 * **New Module Installer** - A new Module Installer allows you to find and install modules within RTXI itself.
