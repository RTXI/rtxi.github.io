   You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you? 
   </p>

   <p>We recently updated the site. It's an improvement, but it broke a bunch of links. Bear with us and wait for whatever search engine you're using to re-index the site. In the meantime, check out the new site. If you can't find what you need, <a href="https://github.com/rtxi/rtxi.github.io/issues">just let us know.</a></p>
